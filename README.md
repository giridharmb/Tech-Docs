# Threading Models: Rust, Go, and Python

## Rust
- **Thread Type:** True OS-level threads
- **Multi-threading:** Supports true multi-threading
- **Multi-core Usage:** Can utilize multiple cores effectively
- **Notes:** 
  - Uses 1:1 threading model (one OS thread per Rust thread)
  - Provides both low-level threading primitives and higher-level abstractions

## Go (Golang)
- **Thread Type:** Goroutines (lightweight, green threads)
- **Multi-threading:** Supports concurrent execution via goroutines
- **Multi-core Usage:** Can utilize multiple cores effectively
- **Notes:** 
  - Uses M:N threading model (M goroutines mapped to N OS threads)
  - Go runtime schedules goroutines across available OS threads

## Python
- **Thread Type:** Depends on implementation
  - CPython (standard): OS-level threads, but with Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
  - Other implementations (e.g., Jython, IronPython): May use true threads
- **Multi-threading:** 
  - CPython: Limited by GIL for CPU-bound tasks
  - Other implementations: May support true multi-threading
- **Multi-core Usage:**
  - CPython: Limited for CPU-bound tasks due to GIL
  - Can use multiprocessing module for multi-core parallelism
- **Notes:** 
  - CPython uses 1:1 threading model, but GIL limits concurrent execution of Python bytecode
  - Asyncio provides concurrent I/O-bound operations using coroutines (not true multi-threading)

## Summary
- **True OS-level Threads:** Rust, Python (with caveats)
- **Green Threads:** Go (goroutines)
- **True Multi-threading:** Rust, Go
- **Effective Multi-core Usage:** Rust, Go, Python (with multiprocessing)
